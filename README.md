# Udacity_Predict_Stock_Prices

# Aim: This project aims to build a long-short term memory networks model to predict stock price.

# Dataset: The data set used is historical prices of all the companies in DAX, which is queried from Yahoo Finance and is stored in the DAX_20021505_20190918.csv file. The VDAX dataset is downloaded from ariva and stored in the VDAX_20021505_20190918.csv.

# Software and libraries: I for data preprocessing I used numpy, pandas, datetime. For visualization I used: matplotlib. For the models I used: Sklearn Linear Regression and TensorFlow. For coding I used a colab notebook. All the code and result can be found in the Stock_Price_Prediction_using_LSTM_short_v1.ipynb.
